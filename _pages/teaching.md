[Terry Tao](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/) and [Ravi Vakil](http://math.stanford.edu/~vakil/potentialstudents.html) both have some excellent advice on learning mathematics.

I no longer teach professionally, but explaining mathematics remains one of my favorite things to do (perhaps second only to learning new math :D). Please feel free to email me if there is any mathematics you ever want to discuss!
